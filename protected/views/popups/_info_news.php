    <h2>Merchant Empires News</h2>
    <div class="text">
        <p>Features recently implemented / bugs fixed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Added credits from normal and military bounties to player score.</li>
            <li>The comparison to see if a merchant can see a cloaked merchant is now based on level, not experience.  Same
                level merchants can now see each other.  This is more realistic and simplifies who you need to be worried
                about when moving through enemy space.</li>
            <li>Created the hall of fame table.  No UI yet. If you want to be in there, I suggest killing as many high level
                merchants as possible, trade as much as you can in the next 10 days.</li>
            <li>MA treaty works for defenders.</li>
            <li>New treaty type: Mutual Assistance.  Merchants with a Mutual Assistance treaty will team up when attacking.
                This treaty type can be offered in addition to Free Movement.  It doesn't replace or supercede FM.  I will
                enable this for defenders asap.</li>
            <li>Fixed a number of the notable bugs on SF.  I will fix the last few major bugs before pushing a few features
                in before the games end: cloakable scouts, new treaty type for alliance mutual attack/defense.</li>
            <li>Both games will be ending on 05/15 and a new game starting shortly after.  Two major changes to the game
                require restarting: (1) hexagonal maps (2) dynamic goods, or goods that appear and disappear at ports over
                time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Final scoring mechanism for the games hasn't been coded yet.  Major factors in alliance weighting will not only
            be aggregate exp, but total planets owned and planetary build levels will be major factors.  There will also be
            scoring for top "trader" and "warrior" merchants.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tractor Beams will be used, in part, to tow and place the "automated trading drone ships" which I am working
                on.</li>
            <li>You can actually purchase the Tractor Beam now. Reduced TB lock time to 45 seconds.  If it is not physically
                possible to tow a ship, then the tow link will not appear on the current sector screen.  The amount of
                seconds before TB locks on will appear in the current sector screen.</li>
            <li>Tractor Beam now available at Hyde Dynamics. Tractor Beam takes 60 seconds to lock on the target ship. Once
                locked, the target ship can be towed. Towing a ship expends 2.5 times the normal amount of turns per sector.
                There are some limits to towing.  Any ship with under 250 max cargo and 500 max shields + armor is towable.
                If the towing ship has less than 250 max cargo and less than 750 shields + armor, and the target ship has
                greater than 250 max cargo and 500 shields + armor, then a tow is not possible.</li>
        </ul>
